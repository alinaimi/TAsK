# Traffic Assignment frameworK (TAsK)

The TAsK software implements several algorithms for solving the deterministic static traffic 
 	assignment problem with fixed demands, and the non-additive traffic 
 	assignment problem. 

All code is implemented in the C++ programming language.
This is open-source software distributed under the MIT license.

The software was tested only on the Ubuntu (12.10, 13.10 and 14.04) operating system.

- Various options for direction of descent.
- 3 flow update strategies for path-based algorithms.
- Non-additive shortest path algorithm based on bi-objective label-setting with 
speed-up techniques that exploit the traffic assignment structure.

## Installation instructions

Requirements:
- C++ compiler (the software was tested with gcc 4.8.2).
- Boost library that can be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/.
- To install Boost on linux, start the terminal and type: $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev  

Instructions:
- Download archive with source code.
- Unzip.
- Open terminal, go to the folder with source code and type: make.

By default extended floating point precision is used (long double type).
In order to use double type, comment line
CPPFLAGS += -DUSE_EXTENDED_PRECISION in Makefile and
recompile code if necessary by typing in terminal: make clean; make.

**Note:** If double type is used instead of long double, algorithms might fail to find highly precise
solutions.

## Documentation
API documentation can be found in vendor/Docs/index.html.

## Usage

In order to run the TAsK software one should create a text file with various run parameters first.

### Example data

The archive with source code includes the SiouxFalls data instance from 
https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks. This instance can be used for
research purposes only.

### How to run

After compiling the source code, one can run it with one of the two included parameter files. 
Example parameter files are  
input.params for conventional traffic assignment
and inputNonAdd.params
for non-additive traffic assignment. Please, use these files as templates for creating
other files with parameters.

**Note:** If some of the fields are missing or invalid values are used, the program will
terminate with an error message or failed assertion.

**Warning:** All field names and possible values are case-sensitive.

In order to run code with input.params:
- Open terminal and go to the folder with source code.
- Type in terminal: ./ta input.params.

File input.params allows to solve the additive
traffic assignment problem with the Algorithm B based 
on quadratic approximation
for the SiouxFalls instance.

File inputNonAdd.params allows to solve the non-additive
traffic assignment problem with the path equilibration algorithm
based on Newton step
for the SiouxFalls instance.

### Parameter files

A parameter file must contain the following fields (supported comments \b/\b* for
multiple line comments, \b/\b/ for one line comments):

This field is ignored if option <WRITE_RND_TOLLS_TO_FILE> has empty value.

 			 Works only for additive traffic
 			 assignment. If one tries to choose this option for non-additive 
 			 traffic assignment, then the program will terminate with failed assertion.
  - Astar - A* point-to-point algorithm. If this option is specified,
 			A* will be used for path-based algorithms, and one-source
   			Dijkstra's algorithm for convergence measure. 
   			If this option is specified along with a link- or bush-based algorithm,
   			then for all one-source shortest path calculations Dijkstra's algorithm
   			will be used.
   			Works only for additive traffic
  		    assignment. If one tries to choose this option for non-additive 
 			traffic assignment, then the program will terminate with failed assertion.
 			
 	**Warning:** Astar option does not work with TAPAS. Never use them together.
  - NonAdd - non-additive shortest path.

## Existing problems of the current implementation
- Excessive usage of pointers where references are more appropriate.
- In a few places arrays are used where vectors would be better.
- ObjectManager is responsible for creation of ALL objects.
- StarNetwork and PathBasedFlowMove iterator-like methods are not safe to use in nested loops.
